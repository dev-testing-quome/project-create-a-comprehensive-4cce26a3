## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (for development; PostgreSQL recommended for production)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Testing**:  pytest (Backend), Jest (Frontend)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development and deployment)
* A PostgreSQL database (recommended for production)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL Recommended):**
   - Follow the instructions in the `backend/database.md` file to set up your PostgreSQL database.  For development using SQLite, no further setup is required.

5. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Backend (from backend directory)
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Frontend (from frontend directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
