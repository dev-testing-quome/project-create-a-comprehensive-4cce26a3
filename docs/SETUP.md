# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide helps developers set up their environment for contributing to `project-create-a-comprehensive`, a HIPAA-compliant healthcare patient portal.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * Docker Desktop (for Docker option)
    * PostgreSQL 14+ (or your preferred database, adjustments needed in configuration)
    * Git

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git client
    * Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
    * Postman or similar API testing tool

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install the following extensions:
        * Python
        * ESLint
        * Prettier
        * Docker


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by containerizing the application and its dependencies.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

3. **Development Docker Compose Configuration:**  The project should include a `docker-compose.yml` file.  This file defines the services (database, backend, frontend) and their configurations.  A sample might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
         - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase
         # ... other environment variables ...
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The frontend likely uses a tool like `nodemon` or `webpack-dev-server` for hot reloading.  This is typically configured within the `frontend` directory's build process (e.g., `package.json` scripts).

5. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```


### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires manual installation of dependencies.

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL and create the database as specified in the database configuration files.  You'll likely need to manually create the database and user.  Example using `psql`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
   CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;
   ```


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  A `.env` file (or similar) should list sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.  **Never commit `.env` files to version control.**  Example:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   ```

* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local development environment variables.

* **Configuration for Different Environments:** The application should handle different environments (development, staging, production) through configuration files or environment variables.


## Running the Application

* **Start Commands for Development:**
    * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d --build`
    * **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

* **How to Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or similar port specified in your configuration) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

* **API Documentation Access:**  The project should ideally include API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches for new features, hotfix branches for urgent bug fixes).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:**  Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to enforce consistent code style.  These are typically integrated into the IDE or configured in the project's build process.

* **Testing Procedures:**  Implement unit tests, integration tests, and potentially end-to-end tests.

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools or command-line debuggers.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:**  Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:**  Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for development and testing.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Provide scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  Execute unit tests using a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).

* **Running Integration Tests:**  Execute integration tests to verify interactions between different components of the application.

* **Test Coverage Reports:**  Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow the API design guidelines and write unit and integration tests.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Follow the frontend component architecture and write unit tests.

* **Database Schema Changes:**  Use database migrations to manage schema changes.

* **Adding Dependencies:**  Update the `requirements.txt` (backend) and `package.json` (frontend) files and run the appropriate installation commands.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:**  Check the logs for errors and refer to the project's documentation for troubleshooting tips.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:**  Change the ports used by the application if there are conflicts.

* **Dependency Issues:**  Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and compatible with each other.

* **Environment Variable Problems:**  Verify that the environment variables are set correctly.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:**  Follow the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

* **Pull Request Process:**  Create pull requests for code changes and follow the project's contribution guidelines.

* **Issue Reporting:**  Report issues using the project's issue tracker.  Provide clear descriptions of the problem and steps to reproduce it.


This guide provides a starting point for developers.  The specific commands and configurations might vary depending on the project's structure and technologies used.  Refer to the project's README and other documentation for more detailed instructions. Remember to prioritize HIPAA compliance throughout the development process.  Consult with legal and security experts to ensure your application meets all necessary regulations.
